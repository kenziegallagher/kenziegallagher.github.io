		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>When I created this website, the first word that came to mind was "autonomy". I've always been an independent, 'I'm going to do it myself' kind of girl ever since I can remember. When I was younger, I used to untie my shoelaces after my mom tied them because I wanted to do it myself and I would even unbuckle and rebuckle the seatbelt if anyone else did it for me. #stubbornchild. I'm rather impatient and am usually doing a million things at once but, at the end of the day, I get it done in my own way, and that's the way I like it. I'm not a fan of stereotypes so, to defy the blonde stereotype and to have some fun with it, I incorporated it into the name because you wouldn't expect a blonde to be building websites and messing with code. So, in true autonomous fashion, Blondtonomy was born.</p>
